# 🐍 Python for Data Science – Jupyter Notes

Welcome! This repository contains my personal learning notes and practice notebooks as I study **Python programming with a focus on data science** using Jupyter Notebook.  

It's part of my journey to build a solid foundation in programming, data analysis, and essential data science tools.

---

## 📘 What's Inside

- 🧠 **Python Fundamentals** – Syntax, variables, data types, and basic operations  
- 🔁 **Control Flow** – `if` statements, loops, and logical expressions  
- ✍️ **Functions** – Writing reusable blocks of code  
- 🐼 **Data Structures** – Lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets  
- 📊 **Intro to Data Science** – (Coming soon: pandas, NumPy, and visualization)  
- 📝 **Markdown + Jupyter Tips** – Clean formatting and structured note-taking

## 🧪 Why Jupyter Notebook?

Jupyter allows me to combine **code**, **outputs**, and **explanations** in one place. It's a key tool in data science and ideal for documenting experiments, learning, and sharing insights.

## 🚀 Purpose

This repo is my digital notebook to:
- Reinforce what I learn
- Practice writing clean, readable code
- Prepare for real data science projects in the future
